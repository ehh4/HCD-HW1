### Project goal
The goal of this project is to create and analyze a dataset of monthly article traffic for specified pages from English Wikipedia in the date rage July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2024. The specified pages are related to rare diseases, either about a rare disease or have a section that mentions a rare disease. The list of these pages are given by the rare-disease_cleaned.AUG.2024.csv file. The project collects pageview data using the Wikimedia Analytics Pageviews API, which is documentated {here}[https://doc.wikimedia.org/generated-data-platform/aqs/analytics-api/reference/page-views.html].
